# Browse Mask (Pre-Alpha Stage)
Mask your browsing habits by adding lots of noise in form of random HTTP/HTTPS connections to a list of general websites in random order with randomized browse time per page, sessions lenghts, open subpages within the domain etc. This helps in emulating user behaviour hard for ISP's, govt. agencies to track. 

This is just an idea for now. Looking for more help. 
```
User: Starts the program 
             |
             |===> Start's a browser in headless mode (Selenium with Firefox/Chrome driver)
                             |
                             |===> Program sends commands to control the headless browser
                                           |
                                           |===> Masks user behaviour
